# dropbox-image-previews

It's great to connect your dropbox account to your screenshot utility. What's less great is trying to share those links on this very website.

I created this simple [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) to automate that process, allowing you to paste a link
into your github issue, comment, or pull request, and Probot will automatically reformat it into a linked image.

**Note:** It may take a refresh to see the image changed, as Github renders the pages entirely server-side, and there's
some Probot-related queuing, tldr: YMMV.
